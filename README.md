## Instructions

The game can be started by clicking a card. If a card is clicked it starts the timer and adds a move to the counter. If two
cards are clicked and they match they are locked into place. If two cards do not match then the cards are flipped back over.
When moves are 25 or below you get 3 stars, 26 to 35 you get 2 stars, 36 to 45 you get 1 star , and 46 and above you get no
stars. When all cards are flipped over then a congratulations screen is shown with how many moves were made , how much time it took, and how many stars were earned.
