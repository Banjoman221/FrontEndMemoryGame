## Instructions

The game can be started by clicking a card. If a card is clicked it starts the timer and
adds a move to the counter. If two cards are clicked and they match they are locked into
place. If the two cards do not match then the cards are flipped back over. When moves are 25
or below you get 3 stars, 26 to 35 you get 2 stars, 36 to 45 you get 1 star , and 46 and
above you get no stars. When all cards are flipped over the congratulations screen is
shown with how many moves were made , how much time it took, and how many stars were
earned.
